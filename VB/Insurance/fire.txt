Scope of cover

The Insurance Policy broadly covers losses due to:
	Fire, lightning, explosion and implosion
	Aircraft damage, riot, strike, malicious damage and terrorism
	Storm, tempest, flood and inundation
	Impact damage, subsidence
	Landslide/rockslide
	Bursting and/or overflowing of water tanks, apparatus and pipes

Property can be insured on depreciated cost (market value) or replacement cost basis. In order to get full protection, insurance on reinstatement (replacement) basis is recommended.
